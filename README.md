Reviews and Ratings: Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for movies.
API Versioning: Support multiple versions of the API to ensure backward compatibility as the API evolves.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and provide informative error messages for easier debugging.
Technologies Used
The OMDB API variant is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used to execute server-side JavaScript code.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the API endpoints and handle HTTP requests and responses.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing movie data, user information, and other related data.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, used to define models and interact with the database.
